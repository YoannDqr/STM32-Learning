The 'CMSIS_Hal' project is a simple program for the Toshiba TMPM330 
using Toshiba TMPM330 Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
the use of Systick in interrupt driven mode.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           10.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           40.00 MHz

The Usart program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  TMPM330:     - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
