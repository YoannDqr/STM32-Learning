The 'CMSIS_Hal' project is a simple program for the LM3S6965 
using EK-LM3S6965 Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
the use of Systick in interrupt driven mode.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =                8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =               12.00 MHz
   - ADC_CLK =                ?.00 MHz
   - CAN_CLK =                ?.00 MHz
   - PWM_CLK =                ?.00 MHz

The Usart program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:   - configured for software Simulator
  EK-LM3S6965: - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
